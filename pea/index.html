        i've never had a name i felt comfortable releasing my art under. nothing
        felt right until i came up with pea eeter. to me, it's a perfect name,
        its so good that i'm thinking about legally changing my name to pea
        eeter. its a dumb name and i think being dumb is awesome. pea eeter is
        my alter ego, the part of myself that is confident enough to release my
        art even if its not perfect. pea eeter is the part of me that dresses in
        silly clothes, dances to music Late at night, pea eeter is the best of
        me. pea eeter is going to release everything i've been working on for
        the past couple years, or rather i am going to release everything i've
        been working on under pea eeter. those who have known me intimately know
        how much of a relief it is for me to finally connect with a name. i came
        up with it because i am a fan of peas, and i eat peas, and eeter is a
        fun way of spelling eater. also its funny cuz it sounds like you're
        stuttering while saying peter. peters also a funny name. i am pea eeter.
